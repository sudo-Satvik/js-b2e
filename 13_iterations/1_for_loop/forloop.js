// For Loop

// Behavior: The initialization is done first, the condition is checked before each iteration, and the increment/decrement is applied at the end of each iteration.
// Use Case: KNOWN ITERATIONS: Use the for loop when you know beforehand how many times the loop needs to run.

// Example: Looping through arrays, fixed iteration counts (e.g., looping through a range)



for (let index = 1; index < 11; index++) {
    console.log(index);
}

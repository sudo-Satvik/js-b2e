// Consider following condition, using forEach and then storing into the variable

// const coding = ["js", "py", "cpp", "java"]

// const values = coding.forEach( (items) => {
//     console.log(items)
//     return items                // Explictly return is also not working here
// })

// console.log(values);            // The undefined below items means the return type

// It means for each doesn't return anything

// Sometime, we have to use the element for performing some operation, but that's not possible here
